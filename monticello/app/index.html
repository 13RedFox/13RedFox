						<p class="wwd__content-text">Increasing prosperity in our lives can be accomplished by having the right frame
							of mind. The truth is, our thoughts are very powerful.
	
							They are capable of influencing every aspect of our daily lives, from our physical health to our social
							behaviors. I’m sure you’ve heard the adage, “As you think, so shall you be.”
	
							If we want to improve our lives, we must first improve our thoughts. Harnessing the power of thought in a
							positive way has the ability to create great change in our lives, including our financial well-being and
							prosperity. But how? How do we take something as intangible as thoughts, and manifest them into a physical
							reality?
	
							We must first understand that being prosperous is more than having a lot of money. Prosperity is a mindset,
							a way of interacting in our lives, and a way of thinking. Mastering this train of thought is not easy, but
							it is simple enough if we keep working on it consistently.
	
							Following are some ideas to help you improve your thoughts, and ultimately attract more prosperity into your
							life:
	
							Be grateful for the blessings in your life right now. Take a few minutes each day to express heartfelt
							gratitude for the good things in your life. Even more powerful, write a few of these blessings down each
							day. This helps to put your focus in the right direction — on abundance, not lack.
	
							Use positive affirmations to begin training yourself to think positively. Use “I am” statements such as “I
							am worthy of all that is good.” Write the statements down and repeat them nightly before bed. Over time,
							this will implant these thoughts into your subconscious mind, and you will begin to naturally believe them.
	
							Creative visualization can help you achieve prosperity by determining what it is you wish to achieve, and
							then thoroughly creating that image in your mind. This works in the same way affirmations do. Our
							subconscious will fill with images of prosperity, and eventually these subconscious “truths” will manifest
							in the physical. “See” yourself as being prosperous, and you will become so.
	
							Encourage yourself with the belief that you can achieve great things. This could also be one of your
							affirmations, but expand on it. If you know you can earn a certain salary, tell yourself you can earn more.
							Allow yourself to believe all things are possible, and you will gain the confidence needed to reach higher
							than you ever imagined you could. If you believe you can do it, you are more likely to take the risks
							associated with people who are highly successful. Prosperity and success go hand in hand, so take risks and
							aim higher.
	
							Start a savings account. As strange as it sounds, think about this: Like Attracts Like. Even if you can only
							afford to put a few dollars into your account every month, it will begin to build up and attract more money.
	
							Finally, believe you are already wealthy. The creative ability of our thoughts is such that we lend more
							power and energy to whatever we consistently focus on. Focusing on lack will create more lack. Focusing on
							wealth and prosperity will create . . . guess what?
	
							Remember that this is a process. You likely won’t change your circumstances in one day. But over time, with
							consistent focus, your thoughts will begin to attract what you want. Once you master this power of thought,
							there are truly no limits to what you can create!</p>

							<p class="news__slider-text">Free directories: directories are perfect for customers that are... searching
								for
								a particular topic. What’s great about them is that you only have to post once and they are good for long
								periods of time. It saves a lot of your time when you don’t have to resubmit your information every week
								or
								every month. The bad news is most of your traffic won’t come from here. I still feel it is worth it to get
								your link out there. Just take one day and set it aside for posting to free directories. You won’t need to
								do it again for at least 6 months.
	
								2. Classified Ads: These are great for work from home businesses. Think about it. Where do people go when
								they are looking for a job? That’s right-the classifieds. The only downside to classified ads is that you
								have to resubmit them quite frequently. Once you find which classifieds bring you the most traffic you can
								concentrate on them and weed the others out. So it is really more time consuming in the beginning, and
								doesn’t have to be later on when you get the hang of things.
	
								3. Free article submissions/ezines: The best way to inform others about your product or service is to
								write
								an article about it. In your authors resource box, you can tell readers about yourself and where they can
								go
								to check out your product or service. This is also an excellent way to get free links to your site if you
								have one. There are a lot of webmasters out there who are looking for good articles they can post on their
								site. If they post yours, that is another site that is doing the advertising for you. All for free.
	
								4. URL Submissions: Probably the quickest and easiest thing to do to advertise your site. Just type “Free
								URL submission” in your search engine. When you get a list just enter the URL you are promoting and click
								submit. That’s it. It only takes a few seconds and your done. Just set a day aside once every 3 months and
								do this.
	
								5. Forum Posts: Put your product or service website in your signature file when you sign up on some
								forums.
								It will be displayed every time you make a post. Try to look for topics that you have some knowledge on,
								and
								can give a relevant answer too. Do not spam anyone, you will get kicked off the forum and you will get a
								bad
								reputation. Get involved asking and answering questions that pertain to your area of business. Forums are
								great because once you make a post it stays there forever. It will get moved to the archives eventually,
								but
								someone could still find it if they were searching the archives. Yes, there are many people who do.
	
								6. Traffic Exchanges: Probably the most time consuming way to advertise for free, but definately the most
								effective. Most forums I have visited have said in many posts that they received a lot of their profit
								from
								traffic exchanges. If you don’t want to spend the time surfing for credits, you do have the option of
								buying
								them. I would look into a program that lets you surf multiple websites at once like crazy browser. There
								are
								others and they are free to download. That way you can just spend one hour a day and get all your surfing
								in
								at once.
	
								7. News-groups: Become involved in a group that has to do with your kind of business. You can usually mail
								the group once per day, but I would encourage you to find something fresh to talk about each day. People
								will tune you out if they see the same message all the time. Remember to never Spam anyone. Only join
								groups
								with the same interests as yours. In other words, don’t sign up for a recipe swapping group when you are
								advertising shaving cream.</p>
