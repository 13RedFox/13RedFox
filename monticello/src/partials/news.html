						<p class="news__slider-text">Free directories: directories are perfect for customers that are... searching
							for
							a particular topic. What’s great about them is that you only have to post once and they are good for long
							periods of time. It saves a lot of your time when you don’t have to resubmit your information every week
							or
							every month. The bad news is most of your traffic won’t come from here. I still feel it is worth it to get
							your link out there. Just take one day and set it aside for posting to free directories. You won’t need to
							do it again for at least 6 months.

							2. Classified Ads: These are great for work from home businesses. Think about it. Where do people go when
							they are looking for a job? That’s right-the classifieds. The only downside to classified ads is that you
							have to resubmit them quite frequently. Once you find which classifieds bring you the most traffic you can
							concentrate on them and weed the others out. So it is really more time consuming in the beginning, and
							doesn’t have to be later on when you get the hang of things.

							3. Free article submissions/ezines: The best way to inform others about your product or service is to
							write
							an article about it. In your authors resource box, you can tell readers about yourself and where they can
							go
							to check out your product or service. This is also an excellent way to get free links to your site if you
							have one. There are a lot of webmasters out there who are looking for good articles they can post on their
							site. If they post yours, that is another site that is doing the advertising for you. All for free.

							4. URL Submissions: Probably the quickest and easiest thing to do to advertise your site. Just type “Free
							URL submission” in your search engine. When you get a list just enter the URL you are promoting and click
							submit. That’s it. It only takes a few seconds and your done. Just set a day aside once every 3 months and
							do this.

							5. Forum Posts: Put your product or service website in your signature file when you sign up on some
							forums.
							It will be displayed every time you make a post. Try to look for topics that you have some knowledge on,
							and
							can give a relevant answer too. Do not spam anyone, you will get kicked off the forum and you will get a
							bad
							reputation. Get involved asking and answering questions that pertain to your area of business. Forums are
							great because once you make a post it stays there forever. It will get moved to the archives eventually,
							but
							someone could still find it if they were searching the archives. Yes, there are many people who do.

							6. Traffic Exchanges: Probably the most time consuming way to advertise for free, but definately the most
							effective. Most forums I have visited have said in many posts that they received a lot of their profit
							from
							traffic exchanges. If you don’t want to spend the time surfing for credits, you do have the option of
							buying
							them. I would look into a program that lets you surf multiple websites at once like crazy browser. There
							are
							others and they are free to download. That way you can just spend one hour a day and get all your surfing
							in
							at once.

							7. News-groups: Become involved in a group that has to do with your kind of business. You can usually mail
							the group once per day, but I would encourage you to find something fresh to talk about each day. People
							will tune you out if they see the same message all the time. Remember to never Spam anyone. Only join
							groups
							with the same interests as yours. In other words, don’t sign up for a recipe swapping group when you are
							advertising shaving cream.</p>
